# Quick View

- Let's do a quick search in google chrome, and discover a tiny little bit of AspnetBoilerPlate. We can see it is really popular, I know should be others things out there, but AspnetBoilerPlate has worked for me.

Specially for me, I usually do angular front end.

So, let's talk about the front end part of AspnetBoilerPlate.

# Who is this for? On the Frontend?

- When it comes to the Frontend of AspnetBoilerPlate, this framework is for you, if you are looking for Rapid Application development and familiar with Angular or Vue.js or React.

This framework will give you the the option of download a complete project which will have the login page, tenant page, multi-tenancy and users and roles.

So, lets go to the download page so we can see the different options when it comes to the frontend.

- Angular15+
- NSwag 13 (https://github.com/RicoSuter/NSwag)
