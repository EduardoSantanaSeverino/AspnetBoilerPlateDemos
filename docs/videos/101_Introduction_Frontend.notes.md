In this video I am gonna share with you a brief introduction to AspnetBoilerPlate framework but this time around we are looking more at the Frontend side of things.
In the past video we looked at the APIs and Backend side of the framework. in the contrary, This time I am going to be talking about more about Angular that the frontend implementation.

Hey, this is Eduardo Santana here, I have been doing software development for many years now, and I wanted to create this series of videos to help you, if you are a student or a new software developer, who is looking to create a new web application and you want to follow a clear path to follow the best practices of object oriented programming.

The main idea is for you to use this AspnetBoilerPlate framework as a start up point for your new web application which will give you the best practices and will save you time on boiler plate code.

Because at the end of the day, in every application there are some repetitive task that you have to do over and over again. and This Framework will give you solid start up point that you can rely on.

In this specific video we are going to are going to talk about:

First, who is this framework for? does it work for you? and after we are gonna talk about some of the most relevant time saving features that this framework is offering.

Now, lets move on to Who is this for?

# Who is this for? On the Frontend?

When it comes to the Frontend, the AspnetBoilerPlate framework offers several options,

but Who is this for? this framework is for someone who is looking for Rapid Application development, but more important someone who is familiar with Angular or Vue.js or React.

This framework will give you the option to download a complete project which will have the login page, tenant page, multi-tenancy page and users and roles management page.

So, lets go and see the download page, so we can see the different options that it offers:

https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Templates

I am more familiar with Angular therefore I will be talking a more closer look to Angular in the coming videos, but as you can see the Template is available to be downloaded with Vue.js , React frameworks as well.

Going back to our presentation, we can see that on the current AspnetBoilerPlate framework is using:

- Angular15+
- NSwag 13 (https://github.com/RicoSuter/NSwag)
- TypeScript 4.8
- Jasmine 4.5

and some on so fort:

Now, let's see the different features.

# Features? On the Frontend?

When it comes to the most relevant Frontend features, we have:

- Token-Based Authentication with Jwt Token functionality will be given to you by default in the template.
- You gonna have as well the Angular Multi-Tenancy management pages provided by the framework.
- Multi-Language Support with L pipe that is right there for you.
- And finally, we have the Proxy Service with Static Data Types generated by NSwag.

I personally think the most relevant and useful feature is this last one, the NSwag implementation. that is why, I wanted to talk about this one in the next slide.

---

# Why do we need NSwag?... lets talk about a brief example for a JavaScript application.

Let me start by saying, In a normal JavaScript web application we need some sort of access the backend APIs in some way.

Most of the time we do use HTTP request to access the backend information.

and for those HTTP request we mostly go for using libraries like Axios or we could just go for vanilla JavaScript XMLHttpRequest class.

Lets see the figure in the screen.

But more specifically in Angular we want to create a Proxy Service class that will hold, that will contain all the backend communication related stuff in there.

So we are going to use a TypeScript Proxy Service that will expose the backend APIs as methods, we are going to see what it means.

Let s look at the figure next slide:

---

# Why do we need NSwag? in Angular code.

Again in from your Angular code you will have ProxyService class which allows you to do HTTP request and you will get access to the Backend APIs end information.

How is it going to work? how do you create this ProxyService with static DataTypes?

So, this Proxy Service will be generated by NSwag,

The way it works is that NSwag will take your Swagger url and from there it will take the Open API specifications, and then it is going to generate your TypeScript Proxy Service for your application.

I know there is more to it, but we are going see in action in the coming videos, for now, this is a simple over view of how this is actually works.

If you want to see more about Nswag you can see the github page: https://github.com/RicoSuter/NSwag, I m going to leave in video description.

Let go back to the presentation.

# Features? On the Frontend? Example

It is very easy to get up up and running with a complete angular application with login page, users and roles management page, Jwt Token out of the box.

Let s go to the demo page again, we we can see how easy it is to start a new application.

- https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Zero/Startup-Template-Angular?searchKey=angular

Lets go to see the page: DEMO the page...

After the demo. . .

# Thank you

I want to leave this video there, If you finding value in this video, give it a thumbs-up. and subscribe for the next videos.

We are going to demo the backend and create a new Swagger API, using PostgreSQL database and EntityFramework.

After that in another video we are gonna show one Angular application and the Student Entity with permissions.

And finally, we are going to see how I do generate the code for a new Entity Class for this Framework.

See you next time.
