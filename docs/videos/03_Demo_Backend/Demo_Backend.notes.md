# Demo Backend

In this video I am gonna share with you a quick demonstration for ASP.NET Boilerplate using PostgreSQL, C#, Entity Framework Swagger API.

---

# Previous Introduction Video

In the previous video we've been talking about ASP.NET Boilerplate. We talked about:

- On the Backend, who is this for?
- Features on the Backend.
- On the Frontend, who is this for?
- Features on the Frontend.
- Why do you need NSwag?

If you have not watch those videos, I strongly suggest you to go over and watch those, so you get a better idea of what we are doing in this video.

Moving on. when it comes to the technologies, it is important that we set the grounds.

---

# Technology / Topics

For you to follow along it is better that you are familiar with the following technologies, but it is not a requirement, because I am going be explaining what you need to follow along.

- MS SQL Server or PostgreSQL
- EntityFramework
- Swagger
- C# Class, Interface, Inheritance, DI
- Docker Container
- No going through each file in the template

---

# Backend Features

Because this Template will give you so much functionality out of the box, it is recommended that you disabled that ones that are not going to be used in your particular application. For sake of simplicity of the video, I will just focus on getting up and running.

- We are using in this video the default Authorization and Authentication
- The default Audit Logs will shown in as bonus.
- And the Generic Repositories will be shown as well.
- But we are leaving for future videos details on the SignalR, Background Jobs and Multi-Tenancy.

---

# What are we doing? - 1

We are following the next steps, for:

1. Start the PostgreSQL container

- Important to mention, we are doing PostgreSQL because is we are just avoiding using MS SQL Server.

2. Quick Overview of the Backend

- We are showing what is the expectation of our testing today. the project up a running.

3. Download the ASP.NET Boilerplate
4. Update the project to use PostgreSQL
5. Migrate the PostgreSQL database
6. Disable Background Jobs, we are not going to use it in this video.

Next slide:

---

# What are we doing? - 2

7. Disable SignalR feature, we are not going to use it in this video.
8. Disable Multi-Tenancy feature, we are not going to use it in this video.
9. Create a new Entity and Add it to DBcontext.
10. Add the Application Service, so we can add logic to our application.
11. Check Swagger Endpoint.
12. Test the CRUD functionality.

---

# Follow Step 1:

- Start the PostgreSQL container:

  - Show the `scripts/db/docker-compose.yml` file.
  - Start the `docker-compose` file.
  - show docker container.

---

# Follow Step 2:

- Quick Overview of the Backend project.

  Quick overview, let s have a quick look at what we are doing, this is the application running Demo of the backend api and swagger application.
  Here you have my Rider IDE, I can click on the solution explorer, and see the different projects. Remember this is Domain Driven Design.
  Let's see the entity model that I just created for this demo. You can see the Student entity class.
  After, let's try to run the application, where I can see the swagger application.
  and I can see the new entity.

  - Outcome preview: `MyCollegeV1` vs `MyCollegeV2`.
  - Insert Entity:

  ```json
  {
    "firstName": "Logan",
    "lastName": "Kim",
    "address": "941 Progress Ave, Scarborough, Ontario, Canada",
    "programName": "Game Programming",
    "doB": "1991-04-10",
    "isActive": true
  }
  ```

---

# Follow Step 3:

- Download the AspnetBoilerPlate:

  - Go to `https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Templates`.
  - Add your project name, mine is: `MyCollegeV1`.
  - Click on Create my project to download.

---

# Follow Step 4:

- Update the project to use PostgreSQL:

  - Open solution `source/MyCollegeV1/aspnet-core/MyCollegeV1.sln` project, in your code editor, for me Rider, In terminal change directory to: `cd source/MyCollegeV1/aspnet-core`.
  - In terminal change directory to: `cd src/MyCollegeV1.EntityFrameworkCore`.
    - Run command: `dotnet add package Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL --version 7.0.3`.
  - Delete `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer` from `MyCollegeV1.EntityFrameworkCore` project, because it will not be used anymore.
    - In Rider: Unload Project, then Edit project file and remove `<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer" Version="7.0.3" />` line.
  - Open file: `src/MyCollegeV1.EntityFrameworkCore/EntityFrameworkCore/MyCollegeV1DbContextConfigurer.cs`, replace `UseSqlServer` with `UseNpgsql`.
  - Remove all migration files under `/MyCollegeV1.EntityFrameworkCore/Migrations` folder. (include `DbContextModelSnapshot`).
  - Open file `src/MyCollegeV1.EntityFrameworkCore/EntityFrameworkCore/MyCollegeV1DbContext.cs`, add the `OnModelCreating` to the `MyCollegeV1DbContext` class.

    ```csharp
    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);

        modelBuilder.Entity<Abp.Localization.ApplicationLanguageText>()
            .Property(p => p.Value)
            .HasMaxLength(100); // any integer that is smaller than 10485760
    }
    ```

  - Open file: `src/MyCollegeV1.Web.Host/Startup/MyCollegeV1WebHostModule.cs`, add the `PreInitialize` to the `MyCollegeV1WebHostModule` class.

    ```csharp
    public override void PreInitialize()
    {
        Configuration.BackgroundJobs.IsJobExecutionEnabled = false;
        System.AppContext.SetSwitch("Npgsql.DisableDateTimeInfinityConversions", true);
        System.AppContext.SetSwitch("Npgsql.EnableLegacyTimestampBehavior", true);
        // https://www.npgsql.org/efcore/release-notes/6.0.html?tabs=annotations
    }
    ```

  - Compile the project:
    - In Rider: click `Top Menu` > `Build` > `Build Solution`.

---

# Follow Step 5:

- Migrate the PostgreSQL database:

  - Open file: `src/MyCollegeV1.Web.Host/appsettings.json`, update the Connection String to your liking, for me: `"User ID=postgres;Password=iJ55BNHuSDCrV5TBR;Host=192.168.22.101;Port=5432;Database=MyCollegeDB_V1;Pooling=true;"`.
  - In terminal change directory to: `cd src/MyCollegeV1.EntityFrameworkCore`.
    - `dotnet ef migrations add InitialMigration` -> this goes under EntityFramework project.
    - `dotnet ef database update` -> this goes under EntityFramework project.

---

# Follow Step 6:

- Disable Background Jobs feature:

  - To disable those you only need to add the line to the Module of your host app, open file: `src/MyCollegeV1.Web.Host/Startup/MyCollegeV1WebHostModule.cs`, update or add the `PreInitialize` method of the `MyCollegeV1WebHostModule` class, code below:

    ```csharp
    public override void PreInitialize()
    {
        Configuration.BackgroundJobs.IsJobExecutionEnabled = false;
    }
    ```

  - More info: `https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Background-Jobs-And-Workers`.

---

# Follow Step 7:

- Disable SignalR feature:

  SignalR is used by several features like Chat and Real Time Notifications. we are not going to used a chat for the moment, therefore commenting out the line of code that we dont need.

  - Open file: `src/MyCollegeV1.Web.Core/MyCollegeV1.Web.Core.csproj`:
    - Comment out the `<PackageReference Include="Abp.AspNetCore.SignalR" Version="8.1.0" />` line.
    - Open file: `src/MyCollegeV1.Web.Core/MyCollegeV1WebCoreModule.cs`:
      - Comment out the `using Abp.AspNetCore.SignalR;` line.
      - Comment out the `typeof(AbpAspNetCoreSignalRModule)` line.
    - Open file: `src/MyCollegeV1.Web.Host/Startup/Startup.cs:`:
      - Comment out the `using Abp.AspNetCore.SignalR.Hubs;` line.
      - Comment out the `services.AddSignalR();` line.
      - Comment out the `endpoints.MapHub<AbpCommonHub>("/signalr");` line.
    - Compile the project:
      - In Rider: click `Top Menu` > `Build` > `Build Solution`.
    - ONLY for Frontend - Open file: `source/MyCollegeV1/angular/src/app/app.component.ts`:
      - Comment out the `import { SignalRAspNetCoreHelper } from '@shared/helpers/SignalRAspNetCoreHelper';` line.
      - Inside `ngOnInit()` function, comment out: `SignalRAspNetCoreHelper.initSignalR();` line.
    - More info: `https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/SignalR-AspNetCore-Integration`.

---

# Follow Step 8:

- Disable Multi Tenancy feature:

  - Open file: `src/MyCollegeV1.Core/MyCollegeV1Consts.cs` Set the `public const bool MultiTenancyEnabled = true;` line to `public const bool MultiTenancyEnabled = false;`.
  - More info: `https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Multi-Tenancy`.

---

# Follow Step 9:

- Create a new Entity and Add it to DBcontext:

  - Create Entity as per sample code below into: `src/MyCollegeV1.Core/Models/Student.cs`.
  - `Student` entity sample code:

    ```csharp
    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.Text;
    using Abp.Domain.Entities;
    using Abp.Domain.Entities.Auditing;

    namespace MyCollegeV1.Models
    {
        public class Student : FullAuditedEntity<int>, IPassivable
        {
            public Student()
            {
                this.IsActive = true;
                this.CreationTime = DateTime.Now;
            }
            public string FirstName { get; set; }

            public string LastName { get; set; }

            public string Address { get; set; }

            public string ProgramName { get; set; }

            public string DoB { get; set; }

            public bool IsActive { get; set; }

        }
    }
    ```

  - Open file: `src/MyCollegeV1.EntityFrameworkCore/EntityFrameworkCore/MyCollegeV1DbContext.cs`, Add the New Student Entity Collection to your data context (`MyCollegeV1DbContext`) class.

    - Add this: `public virtual DbSet<Student> Students { get; set; }`.

  - In terminal change directory to: `cd src/MyCollegeV1.EntityFrameworkCore`.
    - `dotnet ef migrations add AddStudentEntity` -> this goes under EntityFramework project.
    - `dotnet ef database update` -> this goes under EntityFramework project.

---

# Follow Step 10:

- Add the Application Service:

  - Take files in folder: `source/MyCollegeV2/aspnet-core/src/MyCollegeV2.Application/Students` and put it into: `source/MyCollegeV1/aspnet-core/src/MyCollegeV1.Application/Students`.

  - Update the Namespace from: `MyCollegeV2` to `MyCollegeV1`.

  - For me, I created the script to copy those file: located in: `scripts/source/app-service-copy-v1.sh`.

  - Open file: `src/MyCollegeV1.Core/Authorization/PermissionNames.cs`, below the other constants add student constant, add `public const string Pages_Students = "Pages.Students";`.

  - Open file: `src/MyCollegeV1.Core/Authorization/MyCollegeV1AuthorizationProvider.cs`, below the other permissions, add permissions:

    - Add: `context.CreatePermission(PermissionNames.Pages_Students, L("Students"));` below.

  - Check the core module of your application, file: `src/MyCollegeV1.Core/MyCollegeV1CoreModule.cs`, in there probably remove the following line as it is not needed: `Configuration.Localization.Languages.Add(new LanguageInfo("fa", "فارسی", "famfamfam-flags ir"));`.

---

# Follow Step 11:

- Check Swagger Endpoint:
  - Run the host project.

---

# Follow Step 12:

- Test the CRUD functionality:

  - Test the get all student method.

  - Insert Entity in swagger:

  ```json
  {
    "firstName": "Logan",
    "lastName": "Kim",
    "address": "941 Progress Ave, Scarborough, Ontario, Canada",
    "programName": "Game Programming",
    "doB": "1991-04-10",
    "isActive": true
  }
  ```

  - Test with permissions:

    - Stop the host project.
    - Open file: `src/MyCollegeV1.Application/Students/StudentAppService.cs`, uncomment the permission on the top of the `StudentAppService` class: `[AbpAuthorize(PermissionNames.Pages_Students)]`.
    - Re-Run the host project again.

  - Login in swagger:
    - use the username as: `admin` and password as: `123qwe`.

---

# Follow Step 13:

- BONUS - Show Audit logs
  - Show file `src/MyCollegeV1.Web.Host/App_Data/Logs/Logs.txt`.
  - Show Table in database.
- BONUS - Show Generic Repository.
  - Copy custom additional methods from the `source/MyCollegeV2/aspnet-core/src/MyCollegeV2.Application/Students/StudentAppServiceV2.cs`.
  - For me, I created the script to copy those file: located in: `scripts/source/app-service-copy-v2.sh`.
  - See how it looks in the Swagger.
  - We should see the new methods:
    - `GetMyCustomListAsync`, `CreateMyCustomStudentV1`, `CreateMyCustomStudentV2`,
    - Note that the object `_studentRepository` and `Repository` are referring to same object. So you could use one or the other as preference. One is coming from Base class and other other from our own class.

# Thank you

I want to leave this video there.

The next video I am going to show you one Angular application and the Student Entity with permissions applied.

And after, I m going to you, how to generate the code for a new Entity Class using a code generator.

If you finding value in this video, please give it a thumbs-up. and subscribe to get notifications for the next video.

See you in the next one.
